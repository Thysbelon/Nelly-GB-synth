<h1>Nelly GB</h1>
<!--<p>VIDEO WALKTHROUGH EMBED HERE-->
<p>An LV2 and CLAP synthesizer plugin that emulates the Game Boy's APU and converts Midi events into Game Boy APU register writes.
<p>The goal of this plugin is to provide an intuitive way to create music that is accurate to the sound of the Game Boy.

<h2>Midi Event to Game Boy APU Register Reference</h2>
<p>The plugin currently does not expose any parameters directly to the user. Instead, the user can manipulate the plugin's internal parameters using specific Midi events, including undefined Midi CC and SysEx.
<dl>
<dt>SysEx:
<dd>
Contains all of the wavetable data used in a song. This event should be placed at the start of a midi file.  
<br>The wave data consists of values from 0x00 to 0x0F.  
<br>example of a sysex message that contains two waves (line breaks added.):  
<pre><code>F0
0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 0D 0B 08 05 03 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 03 05 08 0B 0D 0F 0F 0F 0F 0F 
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0F 0F 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0F 0F 00 00 
F7</code></pre>
The plugin currently doesn't have a user interface, so I recommend using <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace>Furnace</a>'s wavetable editor to create waves, then copy and paste the hexadecimal representation of the wave data into a midi sysex message.
</dd>
<dt>Midi Note On:
<dd>This midi event affects multiple GB registers:
	<ul>
	<li>Sets the pitch to the pitch of the note
	<li>Triggers the channel if Legato Mode is off.
	<li>Resets the volume (and envelope) of the channel if it was silenced by a note off event. The values are reset to whatever the last CC-defined value was.
	</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Midi Note Off: 
<dd>Silences the channel.  
<br>(On channels with an envelope, envelope direction will be set to "up" and envelope length will be set to zero.)  
<br>Because the Game Boy APU doesn't have anything like a note off, the plugin is designed so that midi note off events only have a temporary effect on the Game Boy APU. If the volume (or envelope) is changed or another note is played, the channel will no longer be silent.
<dt>Pitch Bend:
<dd>Changes the pitch of a channel without triggering it.  
<br>Currently, this plugin does not allow the user to change the pitch bend range, but this will be added in a future release. In the meantime, the user can create large pitch bends by using Legato Mode.
<dt>Volume MSB (CC07):  
<dd>Sets the volume of the channel
<dt>Pan (CC10):  
<dd>Sets the stereo panning of the channel. The Game Boy can only pan hard left, hard right, or center.
<dt>Pan Mute (CC09) (custom):  
<dd>In the Game Boy APU, it is possible to mute a channel by setting the panning value to 0. The Midi pan control does not have this functionality, so CC09 sets the panning register to 0 when CC09 is 127.
<dt>Envelope Direction (CC12) (custom):  
<dd>Sets whether the volume envelope should gradually increase or decrease volume. 127 is increase, 0 is decrease.
<dt>Envelope Length (CC13) (custom):  
<dd>Sets the length of the envelope. 0 disables the envelope and makes volume constant. A high number is a long envelope, a low number is a short envelope.
<dt>Sound Length Enable (CC14) (custom):  
<dd>Sets whether the sound length feature is enabled or disabled. 0 is disabled, 127 is enabled.
<dt>Sound Length (CC15) (custom):  
<dd>Sets the length before the channel is automatically silenced. The lower the value, the longer the time before the channel is silenced.
<dt>Sweep Speed (CC16) (custom):  
<dd>Sets the speed of a sweep (singular pitch slide up or down).
<dt>Sweep Shift (CC17) (custom):  
<dd>Sets how much the pitch changes each "step".
<dt>Sweep Direction (CC18) (custom):  
<dd>Sets whether a sweep should cause the pitch to increase or decrease.
<dt>Duty Cycle (CC19) (custom):  
<dd>Sets the shape of a square's waveform.
<dt>Noise Length (CC20) (custom):  
<dd>Sets whether the noise should be long (percussive) or short (slightly melodic). 0 is long and 127 is short.
<dt>Wave Index Selector (CC21) (custom):  
<dd>Sets the waveform to use for the wave channel from the list given in a sysex message. A midi file can have up to 127 waves.
<dt>Disable Note Off (CC22) (custom):  
<dd>Doesn't affect any one GB register. When this CC is 127, midi note off events have no effect at all.
<dt>Legato Footswitch (CC68) (semi-custom):  
<dd>Doesn't affect any one GB register. When this CC is 127, Legato Mode is turned on and any Midi Note On events will change pitch without triggering the channel and resetting envelopes. (midi note off events also have no effect when Legato Mode is on)
</dl>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<h3>I Recommend Reading Game Boy APU Documentation</h3>

<p>Because this plugin converts midi events to Game Boy APU register writes, understanding how the Game Boy APU functions will be very helpful for making music using this plugin. Please read <a href=https://gbdev.io/pandocs/Audio.html target=_blank>Pan Docs' section on Game Boy Audio</a>.

<h3>You May Hear Loud Notes When Seeking Through a Song</h3>

<p>After a midi note off event, the plugin will silence that channel; however, if you seek to a large gap in between two notes, the plugin will "forget" that the channel should be silent right now and play a very loud note.  

<p>To work around this, it is recommended to manually silence the channel for long gaps in notes. You can manually silence a channel by setting volume (CC07) to 0; for all channels except wave, you will also need to set envelope direction (CC12) to 127 (to prevent an audio pop) and insert a short note (to trigger the channel so that the volume change is read).

<h3>Close Notes Silencing Each Other</h3>

<p>If, when editing the song, you notice that notes right next to eachother seem to be silencing eachother, try zooming in very closely; you'll likely see a very small overlap between the two notes. Remove this overlap so the notes will play properly.

<h3>If Playback is Paused, the Wave Channel Will Be Inaudible On the Piano Roll</h3>

<p>This happens because this plugin resets its internal emulated APU whenever playback is paused. This is necessary in order to make sure that loud sounds do not continously play when playback is paused, but it also clears wave data from the APU's memory (though the wave data is still stored in the plugin's memory, and the correct wave will be played when resuming the song).

<p>I work around this by placing my notes on channel 1 or 2, then moving those notes to channel 3. This workaround works best if you also have each midi channel on a separate track in your DAW.
